### Using the SAML Plugin in WPengine or similar ###

This kind of WP hosting used to cache plugins and protect the wp-login.php view.
You will need to contact them in order to disable the cache for this SAML plugin and also allow external HTTP POST to
wp-login.php


### If you used this plugin before 2.2.0 with just-in-time provision active ###

To mitigate that, place the script at the root of wordpress and execute it (later remove it)
